### Reflections and Comments
- This was tough. We worked through what we could together step by step, with some help from Chance we were able to successfully get the cart items rendered to the home page, and the total rendered at the top of the home page. We were working on the table in cart.js when Ryan encouraged us to finish and submit what we had.
